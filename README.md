# ITIC-Projects (Task 7)

Train a model that predicts sentiment (Sentiment column) based on the textual content of the dataset (Text column).
- Use the dataset described in TASK6.
- Split the data into train, validation, and test sets.
- Use NLTK for cleaning, Lammatization, stopword removal.
- Build TF-IDF features using NLTK.
- Train a neural network model.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Use Word2Vec features (use gensim library).
- Compare results of TF-IDF vs Word2Vec features (Precision, recall, F1, AUC, ROC)
- OPTIONAL: Deploy your model on AWS Sagemaker.
